   <h3> Things I love to do </h3>

   <p align=”justify”> The things I love to do are: reading, doing math problems, talking to my friends and family. My favourite sport would be table tennis, I didn't always have interest in the sport but in the recent times I have been attracted by the sport. My favourite books are: Ponniyin Selvan, Harry Potter, Daughter of the Deep, Kane Chronicles. Not only do I love to read but I love to write my own stories too,
    I personally love writing novels in mystery or thriller genre. I also enjoy watching mystery/thriller movies. I am not the type of person who likes to be locked inside the house, I like to go out especially to other countries/states, I love exploring new stuff.</p>
